## **Design**
### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T08-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T08-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `customerdelete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

> **_NOTE:_** The sequence diagram shows a simplified execution of the `DeleteCustomerCommand`.

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.
### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The **UI** consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g. `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `CustomerListPanel`, `StaffListPanel`, `DrinkListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The **UI** component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T08-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T08-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The **UI** component:
* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* Keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* Depends on classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Customer`, `Staff`, and `Drink` objects residing in the `Model`.
* Contains a tabbed interface allowing users to switch between staff management, customer records, and the drink catalog.
* Features visual elements like charts to display customer metrics and sales data when requested.

The `HelpWindow` component is shown when you execute a help command. It contains a link to the detailed user and developer guide on this CafeConnect documentation website.
### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T08-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("customerdelete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteCustomerSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `customerdelete 1` Command" />

> **_NOTE:_** The lifeline for `DeleteCustomerCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCustomerCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCustomerCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a staff).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCustomerCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.
### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T08-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="850" height="1500" />

The `Model` component,

* stores Caf√©Connect data i.e., all `Person`, `Staff`, `Customer` and `Drink` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList`, `UniqueStaffList`, `UniqueCustomerList` and `UniqueDrinkList` objects).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person`, `Staff`, `Customer` or `DrinkList` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>`, `ObservableList<Staff>`, `ObservableList<Customer>` and `ObservableList<Drink>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

> **_NOTE:_** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>
### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.
## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Staff Management System

#### Adding a staff to the addressbook

<puml src="diagrams/AddStaffSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="AddStaffSequenceDiagram" />

`AddressBookParser` creates an instance of `AddStaffCommandParser` to parse the user input string.

`AddStaffCommandParser` first extracts values corresponding to the prefixes `sid/`, `n/`, `p/`, `e/`, `a/`, `role/`, `shift/`, `hours/`, `rating/`, and `t/`.
It ensures that:
- The **ID prefix** `sid/` must contain a valid staff ID.
- The **phone prefix** `p/` must contain a valid phone number.
- The **email prefix** `e/` must contain a valid email address.
- The **address prefix** `a/` must contain a non-blank address.
- The **role prefix** `role/` must contain a non-empty role.
- The **shift prefix** `shift/` must contain a non-empty shift.
- The **hours prefix** `hours/` must contain a non-negative integer.
- The **rating prefix** `rating/` must contain a valid positive decimal value.
- The **tag prefix** `t/`, if provided, must contain one or more non-empty tags.

If any of these constraints are violated, `AddStaffCommandParser` throws a `ParseException`. Otherwise, it creates a new instance of `AddStaffCommand` based on the user input.

---

`AddStaffCommand` stores the staff to be added, represented as a `Staff` instance.

Upon execution, `AddStaffCommand` first checks the model for duplicate staff. If no existing staff member with a matching (case-insensitive) staff id is found, it adds the new staff member to the catalog.

> **_NOTE:_** CafeConnect identifies a staff member as a duplicate if their `SID` matches (case-insensitive) with an existing staff member in the catalog. Attempting to add a duplicate will result in an error.

#### Deleting a staff from the catalog

The delete staff feature allows users to remove staff from the catalog by specifying the staff's index in the displayed list.

The implementation follows the command pattern where `AddressBookParser` identifies the command type and delegates to `DeleteStaffCommandParser` to create the appropriate command object.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteStaffSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="DeleteStaffSequenceDiagram" />

`AddressBookParser` creates `DeleteStaffCommandParser` to parse user input string.

`DeleteStaffCommandParser` extracts the index from the command arguments and ensures:
- The **Index** is a valid positive integer.

If the index is invalid, `DeleteStaffCommandParser` throws a `ParseException`. Otherwise, it creates a new instance of `DeleteStaffCommand` based on the user input.

---

Upon execution, `DeleteStaffCommand` first checks if the index is within the bounds of the filtered staff list. If the index is out of bounds, a `CommandException` is thrown.

If the index is valid, `DeleteStaffCommand`:
1. Retrieves the staff to be deleted from the filtered staff list.
2. Calls `model.deleteStaff(staffToDelete)` to remove the staff from the catalog.
3. Returns a `CommandResult` with a success message.

> **_NOTE:_** CafeConnect only allows deleting staff by index. Once a staff member is deleted, they cannot be recovered unless added again manually.

#### Editing a staff's details

The edit staff feature allows users to modify the details of an existing staff member by specifying the staff's index in the displayed list and the new details.

The implementation follows the command pattern, where `AddressBookParser` identifies the command type and delegates to `EditStaffCommandParser` to create the appropriate command object.

<puml src="diagrams/EditStaffSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="EditStaffSequenceDiagram" />

`AddressBookParser` creates `EditStaffCommandParser` to parse the user input string.

`EditStaffCommandParser` extracts the index and provided fields from the command arguments and ensures:
- The **Index** is a valid positive integer.
- At least one field is provided for editing.

If the input is invalid, `EditStaffCommandParser` throws a `ParseException`. Otherwise, it creates a new instance of `EditStaffCommand` based on the user input.

---

Upon execution, `EditStaffCommand` first checks if the index is within the bounds of the filtered staff list. If the index is out of bounds, a CommandException is thrown.

If the index is valid, `EditStaffCommand`:
1. Retrieves the staff member to be modified from the list.
2. Extracts the updated details from `EditStaffDescriptor`.
3. Constructs a new `Staff` instance using `StaffBuilder`.
4. Checks for duplicate staff entries in the system and throws a `CommandException` if a duplicate is found.
5. Updates the model with the modified staff information.
6. Returns a `CommandResult` confirming the successful edit.

<br></br>

### Customer Management System

#### Adding a customer to the addressbook

<puml src="diagrams/AddCustomerSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="AddCustomerSequenceDiagram" />

`AddressBookParser` creates an instance of `AddCustomerCommandParser` to parse the user input string.

`AddCustomerCommandParser` first extracts values corresponding to the prefixes `cid/`, `n/`, `p/`, `e/`, `a/`, `rp/`, `vc/`, `fi/`, `ts/`, and `t/`.
It ensures that:
- The **ID prefix** `cid/` must start with a "C" followed by digits (e.g., `C1001`).
- The **name prefix** `n/` must contain only alphanumeric characters and spaces, and it cannot be blank.
- The **phone prefix** `p/` must contain only digits and be at least 3 digits long.
- The **email prefix** `e/` must contain a valid email address.
- The **address prefix** `a/` can take any value, but it cannot be blank.
- The **reward points prefix** `rp/` must contain only digits.
- The **visit count prefix** `vc/` must contain only digits.
- The **favourite item prefix** `fi/` can take any value, but it cannot be blank.
- The **total spent prefix** `ts/` must contain only digits representing the amount in dollars.
- The **tag prefix** `t/`, if provided, must contain one or more non-empty tags.

If any of these constraints are violated, `AddCustomerCommandParser` throws a `ParseException`. Otherwise, it creates a new instance of `AddCustomerCommand` based on the user input.

---

`AddCustomerCommand` stores the customer to be added, represented as a `Customer` instance.

Upon execution, `AddCustomerCommand` first checks the model for duplicate customers. If no existing customer with a matching (case-insensitive) customer id is found, it adds the new customer to the customer list.

> **_NOTE:_** CafeConnect identifies a customer as a duplicate if their `CID` matches (case-insensitive) with an existing customer in the list. Attempting to add a duplicate will result in an error.

#### Deleting a customer from the catalog

The delete customer feature allows users to remove customers from the catalog by specifying the customer's index in the displayed list.

The implementation follows the command pattern where `AddressBookParser` identifies the command type and delegates to `DeleteCustomerCommandParser` to create the appropriate command object.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteCustomerSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="DeleteCustomerSequenceDiagram" />

`AddressBookParser` creates `DeleteCustomerCommandParser` to parse user input string.

`DeleteCustomerCommandParser` extracts the index from the command arguments and ensures:
- The **Index** is a valid positive integer.

If the index is invalid, `DeleteCustomerCommandParser` throws a `ParseException`. Otherwise, it creates a new instance of `DeleteCustomerCommand` based on the user input.

---

Upon execution, `DeleteCustomerCommand` first checks if the index is within the bounds of the filtered customer list. If the index is out of bounds, a `CommandException` is thrown.

If the index is valid, `DeleteCustomerCommand`:
1. Retrieves the customer to be deleted from the filtered customer list.
2. Calls `model.deleteCustomer(customerToDelete)` to remove the customer from the catalog.
3. Returns a `CommandResult` with a success message.

> **_NOTE:_** CafeConnect only allows deleting customers by index. Once a customer is deleted, they cannot be recovered unless added again manually.

<br></br>

### Drink Management System

#### Adding a drink to the catalog

<puml src="diagrams/AddDrinkSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="AddDrinkSequenceDiagram" />

`AddressBookParser` creates an instance of `AddDrinkCommandParser` to parse the user input string.

`AddDrinkCommandParser` first extracts values corresponding to the prefixes `n/`, `p/`and `c/`.

It ensures that:
- The **name prefix** `n/` must contain a valid drink name.
- The **price prefix** `p/` must contain a valid positive decimal value.
- The **category prefix** `c/` must contain a non-empty category name.

If any of these constraints are violated, `AddDrinkCommandParser` throws a `ParseException`. Otherwise, it creates a new instance of `AddDrinkCommand` based on the user input.

---

`AddDrinkCommand` stores the drink to be added, represented as a `Drink` instance.

Upon execution, `AddDrinkCommand` first checks the model for duplicate drinks. If no existing drink with a matching (case-insensitive) name is found, it adds the new drink to the catalog.

> **_NOTE:_** CafeConnect identifies a drink as a duplicate if its `NAME` matches (case-insensitive) with an existing drink in the catalog. Attempting to add a duplicate will result in an error.

#### Deleting a drink from the catalog

The delete drink feature allows users to remove drinks from the catalog by specifying the drink's index in the displayed list.

The implementation follows the command pattern where `AddressBookParser` identifies the command type and delegates to `DeleteDrinkCommandParser` to create the appropriate command object.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteDrinkSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="DeleteDrinkSequenceDiagram" />

`AddressBookParser` creates `DeleteDrinkCommandParser` to parse user input string.

`DeleteDrinkCommandParser` extracts the index from the command arguments and ensures:
- The **Index** is a valid positive integer.

If the index is invalid, `DeleteDrinkCommandParser` throws a `ParseException`. Otherwise, it creates a new instance of `DeleteDrinkCommand` based on the user input.

---

Upon execution, `DeleteDrinkCommand` first checks if the index is within the bounds of the filtered drink list. If the index is out of bounds, a `CommandException` is thrown.

If the index is valid, `DeleteDrinkCommand`:
1. Retrieves the drink to be deleted from the filtered drink list.
2. Calls `model.deleteDrink(drinkToDelete)` to remove the drink from the catalog.
3. Returns a `CommandResult` with a success message.

> **_NOTE:_** CafeConnect only allows deleting drinks by index. Once a drink is deleted, it cannot be recovered unless added again manually.

<br></br>

### Customer Purchase and Points System

#### Recording a customer purchase

<puml src="diagrams/PurchaseSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="PurchaseSequenceDiagram" />

`AddressBookParser` creates an instance of `PurchaseCommandParser` to parse the user input string.

`PurchaseCommandParser` first extracts values corresponding to the index, the prefix `n/`, and the prefix `redeem/`.

It ensures that:
- The **customer index** must be a valid positive integer.
- The **drink name prefix** `n/` must refer to an existing drink in the catalog.
- The **redemption prefix** `redeem/`, if provided, must be either "true" or "false".

If any of these constraints are violated, `PurchaseCommandParser` throws a `ParseException`. Otherwise, it creates a new instance of `PurchaseCommand` based on the user input.

---

`PurchaseCommand` stores the customer index, drink name, and redemption status.

Upon execution, `PurchaseCommand` first retrieves the customer at the specified index and searches for the drink in the catalog by name. It then processes the purchase based on the redemption status:

1. For regular purchases:
   - Calculates reward points (10 points per dollar)
   - Updates the customer's total spent
   - Updates the customer's reward points
   - Increments the visit count
2. For point redemptions:
   - Verifies the customer has sufficient points
   - Calculates points needed (100 points per dollar)
   - Deducts points from the customer
   - Keeps total spent unchanged
   - Increments the visit count

> **_NOTE:_** The points calculation follows a fixed rate of 10 points per dollar spent. Redemption follows a rate of 100 points equivalent to $1 in drink value.

<br></br>

### Quick Command Shortcuts

The implementation of shortcut commands (`c` for customers and `s` for staff) provides an efficient way to add new entries with minimal typing.

<puml src="diagrams/ShortcutCommandSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="ShortcutCommandSequenceDiagram" />

`AddressBookParser` detects single-letter commands and routes them to the appropriate handler:
- `c` routes to the customer shortcut handler
- `s` routes to the staff shortcut handler

The shortcut format follows a pattern of `ID:NAME:PHONE` with colon separators.

Upon receiving a shortcut command, the parser:
1. Splits the input at the colon separators
2. Validates that exactly three components are present
3. Creates a new entity with the provided values and default values for other fields
4. Adds the entity to the appropriate list

> **_NOTE:_** Shortcut commands only accept three parameters (ID, name, and phone). Other fields are set to default values and can be updated later using the edit commands.

<br></br>

### Data Storage and Persistence

Caf√©Connect uses JSON-based storage to persist data across application restarts. The storage implementation separates different entity types into distinct files:

- `addressbook.json`: Stores staff and customer data
- `drinkcatalog.json`: Stores drink catalog data
- `preferences.json`: Stores user preferences like window size and position

<puml src="diagrams/StorageSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="StorageSequenceDiagram" />

When saving data, the following sequence occurs:
1. A command that modifies data is executed
2. The model is updated with the changes
3. The storage manager is notified to save the changes
4. The appropriate storage component serializes the data to JSON
5. The JSON data is written to the file system

On application startup, the reverse process occurs:
1. The storage manager attempts to read data from the JSON files
2. If successful, the data is deserialized into model objects
3. If any file is missing or corrupted, a new empty data structure is created

> **_NOTE:_** CafeConnect implements data backup and recovery mechanisms. If a data file is corrupted, the application attempts to back it up before creating a new empty data structure.
